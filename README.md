# 🎯 External Grenade Helper for CS

This is a project I originally developed for CSGO back in 2018, and have recently updated to work with CS2. It’s one of my first external game-related tools — a standalone utility that provides visual assistance for grenade lineups and recoil control.

It displays useful overlays such as lineup markers, throw indicators, and more to help improve your in-game consistency.
